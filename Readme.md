# Matplotlib examples
In this repository, you find several notebooks demonstrating how to use different features of `matplotlib`. Since I was heavily using matplotlib in my PhD thesis and avoided to manipulate the plots in inkscape, the examples are closely related to what I was plotting during my PhD. If you find any errors or want to add something, please write an Issue or Pull Request.

### Create stylesheet
You can create and use your own stylesheet to set different default parameters (figure size, etc) and have different stylesheets i.e. for papers, presentations and your thesis.

### Multi_column_layout
If you want to arange multiple plots in one figure, you find some examples here.

### Plotting vs different Axes
Multiple axes, nonlinear axes and plotting against date/time, this is what you find here.

### Colorplors and floating colorbars
Some hints about how to make colorplots.

### Insets and Zoomins
Please don't make insets with inkscape.
